<h1> Isaac's Movie Rankings </h1>

<h2>My top 3 Movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Inception</h3>

<p>I love christopher Nolan and thrillers. The concept of shared dreams and dreams within other dreams has always been crazy to me. He's such a goated director.</p>

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
 <p> This movie is also awesome. Such a feel good classic. The innocent man framed for his wife's murder and sent to prison. What will happen.. </p>

<h3>Dead Poet's Society</h3>

 <p>Robin Williams portrayal of an english teacher at a preppy New England school teaches the kids to be themselves and embrace doing what they love. A very heartfelt performance and movie alike. <br />
    Was not ready for the ending :'( </p>
